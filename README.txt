This is a step-by-step tutorial where we start with the setup of a Scala.js sbt project and end up having some user interaction and unit testing. The code created in this tutorial is available with one commit per step in the scalajs-tutorial repository on GitHub.

Step 0: Prerequisites
To go through this tutorial, you will need to download & install sbt. Note that no prior sbt knowledge (only a working installation) is required to follow the tutorial.

You will also need to download & install Node.js.

To run the complete tutorial application, you will also need to install jsdom as explained below.
